Product availability, configurations, integrations and deployment scope vary and should be confirmed in a written assessment or agreement.</p></section>
      <section><h2>No clinical advice or patient portal</h2><p>Website content is not medical advice and does not provide patient results. Do not submit patient information or access credentials through this website. Patient access is provided only by an approved facility portal.</p></section>
      <section><h2>External destinations</h2><p>Links to facility or patient portals direct visitors to separately operated or configured applications. Users should verify that they are accessing the correct portal and follow that facility’s terms and authentication process.</p></section>
